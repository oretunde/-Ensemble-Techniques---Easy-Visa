# Ensemble-Techniques---Easy-Visa
EasyVisa has been hired by Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) to help build a data-driven solution to streamline and improve the process of reviewing every visa applicatio, as the current process is very tedious and has become tedious with the increasing number of applications every year. The objective is to analyze the data provided by OFLC, build a predictive model to facilitate the process of visa approval and based on the drivers that significantly influence the case status recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied.

## My Learning
This project involved developing machine learning models to predict visa approval decisions based on applicant and job-related attributes. The goal was to identify key factors influencing visa certification outcomes and optimize decision-making. The analysis began with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which included data cleaning, feature engineering, and correlation analysis to understand relationships between features. Missing values were handled, and categorical variables were encoded for compatibility with machine learning models.

The model-building phase involved Bagging Classifiers (Bagging, Random Forest), Boosting Classifiers (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, AdaBoost), and a Stacking Classifier, leveraging ensemble learning techniques for improved predictive performance. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and cross-validation ensured reliable model evaluation. GridSearchCV was used for hyperparameter tuning, optimizing performance for the best model.

Feature importance analysis was performed to determine the most influential factors in visa certification. The project demonstrated how ensemble learning techniques enhance classification models, helping to identify key applicant characteristics associated with successful visa approval.
